# DM-pinger
Mass ping one of your friends.
For quick use, I recommend looking at the [latest release](https://github.com/YumYummity/dm-pinger/releases/tag/v0.1)

# Disclaimer
Selfbotting is against Discord's TOS. This repository is a POC (proof of concept)!

# Features
- DM-pinger will automatically find discord accounts on your computer, so you can quickly spam your friend's DMs without getting your token
- DM-pinger includes optional webhook logging, including ETA, and amount pinged
- Auto-Stop when your ex-friend blocks you (this is probably the biggest risk, as long as you set a reasonable delay. I recommend 1.5 second delay)

# To-Do
- Nothing, make an issue for request

# Compiling
Set the variable 'EXE' to True in the code

# Crediting
You must credit me if you use this code anywhere else. More info in [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/YumYummity/dm-pinger/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
