# dm-pinger
Mass ping one of your friends.
For quick use, I recommend looking at the [latest release](https://github.com/YumYummity/dm-pinger/releases/tag/v0.1)

# selfbotting
Selfbotting is against Discord's TOS. This repository is a POC (proof of concept)!

# features
- dm-pinger will automatically install requirements
- dm-pinger will automatically find discord accounts on your computer, so you can quickly spam your friend's DMs without getting your token
- dm-pinger includes optional webhook logging, including ETA, and amount pinged
- auto-stop when your ex-friend blocks you

# to-do
- Nothing, make an issue for request

# compiling
Set the variable 'EXE' to True in the code

# crediting
You must credit me if you use this code anywhere else. More info in [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/YumYummity/dm-pinger/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
